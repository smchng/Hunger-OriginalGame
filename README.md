# Hungry-OriginalGame

Game:
The game is an adventure type RPG. The camera angle is like the games Pokemon and Moonlighter where it is mostly pointed downwards.
There are 3 levels and a boss level. 
You start at level 1 with only 1 type of enemy and as you progress, the amount of enemies increases with different enemies appearing.
There are obstacles in different levels that cause you to walk in a certain direction.
This also causes the enemies to become drawn to you. At a certain threshold, the
enemies will follow you in order to increase the difficulty.
To complete the level you need to reach the chest and click on it ot proceed to the cutscene. At
the end of each level a comic will be shown to give the game a storyline. 
There are health packs on the second level and boss level. A single pack will heal you 5 points.
Each interaction has a sound effect so attacking, getting hurt, healing, enemies getting
hit and button pressing.

Controls:
To attack enemies, you need to click with the mouse and to move you use WASD keys. You can also dash
to move faster by clicking space but this uses up energy. In order to dash again you
need to wait for your energy to increase.
